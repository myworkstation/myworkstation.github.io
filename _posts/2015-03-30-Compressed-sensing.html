compressed sensing:<br>
algorithms for compressed sensing<br>

y=Ax<br>

matrix A is the measurment matrix of x.<br>
x is the signal we want to recover,it's a sparse signal.<br>
y is the signal we have sampled.<br>

A can be idenpendent idential distributed nromal distrubution matrix or a partial DFT matrix.<br>

we have some algorithms to recover x:<br>
1.convex optimalzation<br>
2.iterative thesholding algorithm<br>
3.turbo compressing sensing<br>
4.AMP iterative method<br>
5.MP iterative method<br>

the connect and difference between these method should be carefully study on these two weeks.<br>

underdetermined system<br>
