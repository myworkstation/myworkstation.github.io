compressed sensing:
algorithms for compressed sensing

y=Ax

matrix A is the measurment matrix of x.
x is the signal we want to recover,it's a sparse signal.
y is the signal we have sampled.

A can be idenpendent idential distributed nromal distrubution matrix or a partial DFT matrix.

we have some algorithms to recover x:
1.convex optimalzation
2.iterative thesholding algorithm
3.turbo compressing sensing
4.AMP iterative method
5.MP iterative method

the connect and difference between these method should be carefully study on these two weeks.
